### Welcome to NSW Small Business Energy Alliance

![NSW Small Business Energy Alliance. Uniting for Fair Energy Prices & Success. Advocate Educate Collaborate.](/assets/Banner.jpg)

We exist for the sole purpose of supporting small business as they attempt to navigate what can be at times, the National Electricity Market otherwise knows as the "NEM" because YOU deserve the same voice and bargaining power as YOUR large market counterparts and politically the mums and dads of this country to demand a fairer deal for energy pricing. 

NSW Small Business Energy Alliance
The NSW Small Business alliance is the first of a series of national campaigns & subscription based alliances set to take off around the country with the sole intent of aiming to <b>ADVOCATE, EDUCATE and COLLABORATE</b> with and for Small Businesses to empower them with the <b>support</b> <b>knowledge</b> and p<b>artnershops</b> to ease the burden that electricity prices and regulations can have on day to day operations and to help them thrive. 

In the coming months with the support of local councils,  we will be holding local <b>Advocacy</b> workshops to bring the Alliance to you with the intent of holding open forums to answer your questions and let you know how we can help. we will be taking the campaign to other states and small business owners later in the year under differenct campaigns, so if you are outside of NSW , watch this space and we encourage you to join our newsletter subscription list to find out when we are coming to a state near you.Dont worry we wont SPAM you daily!.  

<b>Retailer Partnerships:</b>  

We are currently in discussion with energy retailers around the country negotiating to bring you exculisve energy pricing that you wont find in the market and by boltering our numbers we increase our buying power.  

We will keep you posted via the website and newsletters as these negotiations draw closer to an end.  

Remember we are specifically here for you because we know and agree that as the Australian Small Business movement,you deserve a fairer go and we wont stop until we see that happen.


Combined you are the greatest energy consumers by volume in our nation and the hard work you put in goes a long way to keeping our energy retailers in business.
