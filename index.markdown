### Welcome to NSW Small Business Energy Alliance

![NSW Small Business Energy Alliance. Uniting for Fair Energy Prices & Success. Advocate Educate Collaborate.](/assets/Plans.svg)

NSW Small Business Energy Alliance is the first of a series of a group of Energy focused consultative, advocacy , educational and collaborative movements targeted at helping small business by providing access to some of the sharpest prices in the electricity market along with services designed to empower small business with the tools, education and confidence to navigate the market, in partnership with NSW Small Business Energy Alliance. With the intention of helping Small Business owners to ease the financial  burden that comes with owning and operating small business in Australia.

In the coming months with the support of local councils,  we will be holding local <b>Advocacy</b> workshops to bring the Alliance to you with the intent of holding open forums to answer your questions and let you know how we can help.  

We will be taking the campaign to other states and small business owners in the very near future so watch this space, however this doesnt mean we cant help mall business colleagues in other states immediately. So please, dont struggle in silence, reach out,  if we can assist in anyway rest assured, We WILL.  

We encourage small businesses to join our mailing list to keep up to date with the latest news onb  when we are coming to a state near you and how we can help (Dont worry we wont SPAM you daily!.)   

<b>Retailer Partnerships:</b>  

We have received very encouraging feedback from a number of Energy retailers who support our movement and are keen to help deliver dicounts on energy pricing.  
By bolstering our numbers we increase our buying power and audience and draw the attention from the market that is needed to help toward you become sustainable.  

We will keep you posted via the website and newsletters as these negotiations draw closer to an end in the coming weeks.  

Remember we are here for you because we carem we know and agree that as the Australian Small Business movement,you deserve a fairer go and we wont stop until we see that happen.


Combined you are the greatest energy consumers by volume in our nation and the hard work you put in goes a long way to keeping our energy retailers in business and our country moving forward.
