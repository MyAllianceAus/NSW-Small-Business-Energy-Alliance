NSW Small Business Energy Alliance is the first of a series of a group of Energy focused consultative, advocacy , educational and collaborative movements target at helping small business with providing the sharpest prices in the electricity market along with the previously mentioned services designed to empower small business with the tools, education and confidence to navigate the market in partnership with NSW Small Business Energy Alliance for the simple end result of helping them lighten the financial load and burden that comes with owning and operating small business in Australia.


In the coming months with the support of local councils,  we will be holding local <b>Advocacy</b> workshops to bring the Alliance to you with the intent of holding open forums to answer your questions and let you know how we can help.  


We will be taking the campaign to other states and small business owners in the very near future so watch this space. This doesnt mean we cant help out small business colleagues in other states in the meantime so please reach out if we can assist in anyway.  

We encourage all small business to join our mailing list to keep up to date of out when we are coming to a state near you.Dont worry we wont SPAM you daily!.  

<b>Retailer Partnerships:</b>  

We have received very promising and productive feedback from a number of Energy retailers who support the need to focus on you and bring you exculisve very sharp discounts on energy pricing by bolstering our numbers we increase our buying power and audience.  

We will keep you posted via the website and newsletters as these negotiations draw closer to an end in the coming weeks.  

Remember we are specifically here for you because we know and agree that as the Australian Small Business movement,you deserve a fairer go and we wont stop until we see that happen.


Combined you are the greatest energy consumers by volume in our nation and the hard work you put in goes a long way to keeping our energy retailers in business.
