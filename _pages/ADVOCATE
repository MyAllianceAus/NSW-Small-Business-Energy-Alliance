<p>My name is Andrew Smith, born of the working belt of metropolitan Western Sydney. I have spent the last 37 years in corporates spanning Banking, Telecommunications, IT, Utilities, Senior Service Delivery and Leadership. With over a decade in the billing and contracts space working for one of our local Energy Retail businesses then onto consulting in the utilities consultancy space.I have spoken to and worked with tens of thousands of small business customers over the years who have fought just to keep their doors open and some not so lucky which and being an absolute empath, these ones really sadden me and break my heart.
</p>
<p>Most recently I worked a very short tenure for a business that provides embedded network management and operations and I must say i was gutted at what I saw and learnt of the embedded network businesses and how the tenants were being treated and policy and regulations not understood or at times possibly disregarded.</p>

<p>So let me say to those small business tenants in embedded networks YOU ARE THE SOLE REASON that the NSW Small Business Energy Alliance was born, because you deserve better and you have my word that each and every small business including those embedded network tenants we deal with will get nothing less than 100% comitment from myself and from my business to bring to you a FAIR GO a fair environment where not only are you ADVOCATED for but we will work tirelessly to bring you EDUCATION, to learn how to effectively navigate the utilities market.</p>
<p>Through additional free and subscription based paid services bring to you the rates, tools,knowledge,advocacy and support to achieve the outccomes you deserve</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Andrew Smith</p>
<p>CEO & Founder</p> 
<p>MY Alliance</p>
