# Advocacy for Small Business Energy Consumers

## Introduction
At NSW Small Business Energy Alliance, we are dedicated to advocating for the rights and interests of small business energy consumers. Our goal is to ensure fair and affordable energy rates for all, especially for those in embedded networks who often face unique challenges.

## Our Mission
Our mission is to:
- **Fight for Fair Energy Prices**: We work tirelessly to negotiate better energy rates for small businesses and embedded network tenants.
- **Educate and Empower**: We provide resources and information to help consumers make informed decisions about their energy usage and contracts.
- **Resolve Disputes**: We advocate on behalf of consumers in disputes with energy retailers, embedded network operators, and network operators.

## Success Stories
### Case Study 1: Credit Union in NSW  
We had to involve the NSW Energy Ombudsment after a retailer recently refused to honour the energy rates they had provided the credit union with.  
Using our market knowledge we enagaged the ombudsmen to mediate. The end result was the retailer honouring the rates they had originally issued resulting in big savings for one very happy customer.

### Case Study 2: Retail Shop in Sydney
A retail shop in Sydney was struggling with high energy costs due to their embedded network. Our advocacy efforts resulted in a re-negotiated contract, saving the shop 25% on their energy bills.

### Case Study 3: Manufacturing Unit in Newcastle
We assisted a manufacturing unit in Newcastle in resolving a dispute with their energy retailer. Our intervention led to a favorable resolution and a significant refund for overcharges.
