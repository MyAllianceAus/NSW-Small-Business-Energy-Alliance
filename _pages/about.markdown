We exist for the sole purpose of supporting small business because they deserve the same voice as their large market counterparts and the mums and dads of this country to demand a fairer deal for energy pricing. 

NSW Small Business Energy Alliance
is the first of a number of national campaign & subscription based alliances  deals designed to support you via exclusive rates available only to members.

In the coming months we will be taking the campaign to other states and small business owners so we encourage you to sign up to our newsletter to keep advise of when the campaign is coming to you state and small business.

We are currently in discussion with a select few retailers, the best of the best who already have the sharpest in the market, however we are asking them to partnership with us to bring you even better exclusive prices and collaboration to provide second to none service.

Remember we are specifically here for you because we are also Australian, we respect and appreciate the blood, sweat and tears, the small businesses provide to our great country and we know you aren't being heard as well as you should be.

Combined you are the greatest energy consumers by volume in our nation and the hard work you put in goes a long way to keeping our energy retailers in business.
