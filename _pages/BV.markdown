### What is Bill Validation?

![NSW Small Business Energy Alliance. Uniting for Fair Energy Prices & Success. Advocate Educate Collaborate.](/assets/BV.jpg).




Bill Validation involves NSW Small Business Energy Alliance receiving a copy of your bill at the same time you do. 
We then run your invoice through our bill validation services to make sure you have been billed correctly by your retailer, some of the checks include:  

* Ensuring you are billed for the correct property.  

* Ensuring you have been billed for the correct number of days.  

* Ensuring you have been billed using the correct discount percentage. 

* Ensuring you havent been billed any additional costs not required of you. 

* Ensuring your invoice has been generated with the correct network tariff assigned to you.  

* Ensuring your invoice is compliant with the better bills guidelines version 2.  

* You will receive a billing report for each site advising either "ok to pay" or "do not pay" and we will initiate a bill query with your retailer and request a rebill if required.  

* At the end of the bill query process with your energy retailer we will advise the outcome and if a rebill is required or if it is now ok to pay your current bill.
