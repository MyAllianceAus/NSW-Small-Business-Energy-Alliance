- About Us: 
      we exist for the sole purpose of supporting small business because they deserve the same voice as thier large market counterparts and the mums and dads of this country. 

    NSW Small Business Energy Alliance
      is the first of a number of national campaign & subscription based alliances  deals designed to support you via exclusive rates available only to members.
      in the coming months we will be taking the campaign to other states and small business owners so we encourage you to sign up to our newsletter to keep advise
      of when the campaign is coming to you state and small business.
      We are currently in discussion with a select few retailers , the best of the best who already have the sharpest in the market , however we are asking them to
      partnership with us to bring you even better exclusive prices and collaboration to provide second to none service.
      Remember we are specifically here for you because we are also Australian, we respect and appreciate the blood , sweat and tears , the small busines provide to
      our great country and we know you arent being heard as well as you should be/
      Combined you are the greatest energy consumers by volume in our nation and the hard work you put in goes a long way to keeping our energy retailers in business.

     My name is Andrew Smith , born and bread from the working belt of NSW, Western Sydney I have spent the last 37 years in coporates spanning telecommunications,IT ,Utilities
     with over a decade in the billing and contracts space within one of our local Energy retailer businesses , utilities consultancy. and I have spoken to and worked with tens of thousands of
     small business customers over the years who have fought just to keep thier doors open and some not so lucky which, being an absolute empath saddens me greatly.
     Most recently i worked a very short 3 month tenure with a business that provides embedded network management and operations. and I must say i was gutted at what I saw and
     learnt of the embedded network businesses.
 
   So let me say to those in embedded networks YOU ARE THE SOLE REASON that the NSW Small Business Energy Alliance was born, because you deserve better and you have my word that
